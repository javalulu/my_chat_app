---

## Technical Requirements Implementation Analysis

### 1. Multi-user Design (Mini Platform)

Implementation includes user registration/login via Firebase Auth, unique UID/email identification, user list display (excluding self), and real-time one-on-one chat support.

### 2. Firebase Data Storage

Complete Firebase Auth for user authentication, Cloud Firestore for real-time database storage, and full Android platform Firebase configuration.

**Database Structure**:
```
Users Collection: {userId} → {uid, email}
chat_rooms Collection: {chatRoomId} → messages SubCollection → {messageId} → {senderId, senderEmail, receiverId, message, timestamp}
```

### 3. Data Sharing Mechanisms

Shared data includes user lists (visible to all users) and chat messages (accessible to conversation participants). Implemented via `getUsersStream()` method and unique chat room IDs generated from sorted user IDs.

### 4. Private Data Protection

Private data protection includes user authentication isolation, chat message visibility limited to participants, and personal preference settings affecting only the current user. Security ensured through Firebase Auth and UI filtering mechanisms.

### 5. Proper Onboarding Process

Onboarding flow: App startup → Authentication state check → Login/Register guidance → Email + Password + Confirmation → Auto verification → Main interface → User list display with chat guidance.

### 6. User Login via Email/Password

Complete authentication system with registration (email validation, password confirmation), login (email/password verification), logout functionality, and comprehensive error handling mechanisms.

### 7. User Preferences (Font Size, Colors, etc.)

Theme switching (dark/light mode), color customization, settings persistence via Provider.  

### 8. Well-designed UX/UI

Modern Material Design interface, responsive layout, clear visual hierarchy, interactive feedback, consistent theming, auto-scroll to latest messages, keyboard adaptation, and intuitive navigation.
